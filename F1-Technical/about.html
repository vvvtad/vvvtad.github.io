            <h1>About The Company</h1>
            <p>Our shop provides stories that have fallen through the cracks of history. It exists to curate a collection of books that haven't been opened in decades—volumes on forgotten folklore, Victorian mourning rituals, and maps to places that no longer exist.
            <br>It is a haven for the literary scavenger who believes that a book is only truly seasoned once it is covered in a fine layer of dust and a little bit of mystery.</p>
