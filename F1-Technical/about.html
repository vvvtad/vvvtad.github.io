            <h1>About Our Company</h1>
            <h2>The Lunar Foundation (1990s)</h2>
            <p>
               Stellarium began as a private hilltop observatory built during the height of the space race. The founder’s grandfather originally funded the construction on a site chosen for its "unusually thin veil" between Earth and the atmosphere.
            </p><br>

            <h2>The Golden Era Expansion (2010)</h2>
            <p>
               As technology advanced, the facility transitioned from a simple telescope outpost to a public-facing planetarium. It was during this time that the iconic gold-accented architecture was established.
            </p><br>

            <h2>The Digital Renaissance (Present Day)</h2>
            <p>
               Today, Stellarium has moved its operations into the digital realm, allowing users to "sign up" for virtual voyages through the Milky Way.

            <h1>About The Founder</h1>
            <p>
                The visionary behind Stellarium is a former astrophysicist who became disillusioned with looking at stars only through cold data on a screen.<br>
                He founded Stellarium to provide a "tactile" experience of the cosmos, believing that every person should feel the weight of the galaxy.
